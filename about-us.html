<p class="p-class"> I miss my family. I keep thinking about them. I also keep thinking about the final project I have for this class.</p>
 <p> My name is Anea Maylisa Serrano Vargas. I am 15 years old. I am the daughter of Carlos Serrano and Tasia Vargas. I have three siblings, and their names are Analeticia, Carlos, and Angel. I am a SMASH Stanford student. My favorite colors are light purple and red. I enjoy dancing, baking, watching netflix, hanging out with my friends, having sleepovers with my cousins, and babysitting. I took dance classes ever since I was 8. Before that I used to take cheerleading. I like to be with my family. They mean the world to me. They are my motivation. I plan to be the first generation in my family to go to college. I wish to be a veterinarian or pediatrician. I want to work with kids or animals. Being in the SMASH Stanford program, it helped me realize the steps I will have to take and that I WILL go to college!.<br>
