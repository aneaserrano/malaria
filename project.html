				<h1> How might we make a easy way to transfer supplies to those who need them?</h1>
				<p>To solve this we made an app which lets the user donate to countries like Nigeria or the Philipinees where malaria is a dominant disease. Also they can choose the amount that they want and they have a variety of differnet suplies to donate, like water, food, mosquitoe nets, bug spray and clothes etc.</p>
				<p> Another pro about our app is that it is very easy to understand and also vey secure.<p>
