				<h1> How might we make a easy way to transfer supplies to those who need them?</h1>
				<p>To solve this we made an app which lets the user donate to countries like Nigeria or the Philipinees where malaria is a dominant disease. Also they can choose the amount that they want and they have a variety of different suplies to donate, like water, food, mosquito nets, bug spray and clothes etc.</p>
				<p> Another pro about our app is that it is very easy to understand, fast, and very trustworthy.<p>
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p> Our mission is for developing countries to be able to get the supplies they need so that dieseases like malaria will not be a threat to anyone especially children who dont have the oppurtunity to get medication or go to the hospital</p>
                <h2> Our App</h2>
                <p> Our app includes the features to learn about the places that need help, learn more about our mission, meet some people that need help, and donate to places that need help. In the learn about the places that need help section we talk about Africa (specifically Nigeria) and the Philipines. In the learn more about our missin section it tells you the main purpose of our app. In the meet some people you get to meet some families in need. In the donation section you can donate many different things.</p>
