				<h1> How might we make a easy way to transfer supplies to those who need them?</h1>
				<p>To solve this we made an app which lets the user donate to countries like Nigeria or the Philipinees where malaria is a dominant disease. Also they can choose the amount that they want and they have a variety of different suplies to donate, like water, food, mosquito nets, bug spray and clothes etc.</p>
				<p> Another pro about our app is that it is very easy to understand, fast, and very trustworthy.<p>
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p> Our mission is for developing countries to be able to get the supplies they need so that dieseases like malaria will not be a threat to anyone especially children who dont have the oppurtunity to get medication or go to the hospital</p>
