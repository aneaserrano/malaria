 <p> My name is Anea Maylisa Serrano Vargas. I am 15 years old. I am the daughter of Carlos Serrano and Tasia Vargas. I have three siblings, and their names are Analeticia, Carlos, and Angel. I am a SMASH Stanford student. My favorite colors are light purple and red. I enjoy dancing, baking, watching netflix, hanging out with my friends, having sleepovers with my cousins, and babysitting. I took dance classes ever since I was 8. Before that I used to take cheerleading. Ive been to Arizona, Nevada, and Cancun, Mexico. I like to be with my family. They mean the world to me. They are my motivation. I plan to be the first generation in my family to go to college. I wish to be a veterinarian or pediatrician. I want to work with kids or animals. Being in the SMASH Stanford program, it helped me realize the steps I will have to take and that I WILL go to college!.<br> </p>

<p> My name is Melany Gutierrez. I was born in San Jose C.A March 3rd 2004. My family is from Mexico and when I was born just at 2 months old we went back to Mexico. We came back to the U.S when I was 3 almost about to turn four. Most of my life I was a only child but when I turned 12 my little brother was born.I went to Cassell elemantary from k-5, I went to Ocala Middle school for 6-8, and finally now I attend William C. Overfelt Highschool. My favorite hobbies are dancing, traveling, cooking, hanging out with my friends and my family I have traveled and visted places (not a lot but some).  I have been to San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Mexico, and Chicago. My favorite food would have to mexican food like tamales, pozole, enchiladas, and tacos. I want to have a career in software enginerring perhaps but I'm not quite sure but I'm open to anything. SCurrently I'm in a program called SMASH it helps students from low income nieghboorhoods (like me) know what college life is like. We stay for a month at Standford overnight and we take classes. We learn a  bunch of stuff and we have the oppertunity to explore other careers. The best thing about it is that it's free.</p>
